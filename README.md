Ember Inputmask is an Ember addon and a wrapper of the
[Inputmask](https://github.com/RobinHerbots/Inputmask) library. It provides a
general use input masking component, along with a set of commonly used masks
including:

  - Credit card number
  - Currency
  - Date
  - Email
  - Number
  - US/Canada phone number
  - US SSN
  - US ZIP Code

## Versions and Upgrading

Inputmask (previously known as `jquery.inputmask`) used to be a jQuery plugin,
but is now a standalone package without relying on jQuery.

Ember Inputmask currently has two branches:

  - [v0.2.x](https://github.com/pzuraq/ember-inputmask/tree/v0.2.x) pulls
    legacy jquery.inputmask 3.2.x from Bower. This branch is in maintenance
    mode. Critical bugs will be fixed, but minor issues will not be fixed and
    new features will not be added.

  - [>v0.4.x](https://github.com/pzuraq/ember-inputmask/tree/master)
    pulls Inputmask 3.3.x from NPM. Bower and jQuery are not required.

Versions prior to 0.4.0 automatically add `jquery.inputmask` into your
application's `bower.json` file. If you are upgrading from a pre-0.4 version to
0.4.x, feel free to remove it from `bower.json`.

In case you are using v0.3.0 of this addon -- it was a versioning mistake. In
fact, v0.3.0 is older than v0.2.1 and we don't recommend it. Feel free to
upgrade to the latest version of either v0.2.x or v0.4.x.

## Installation

```sh
$ ember install ember-inputmask
```

## One Way Input Mask

```hbs
{{one-way-input-mask value mask='999-aaa-***' update=(action (mut value))}}
```

This component extends from the [ember-one-way-controls](https://github.com/DockYard/ember-one-way-controls) addon and follows the data-down-actions-up (DDAU) pattern. You should use the "one-way" components in this addon as the "non-one-way" versions are deprecated as of `0.5.0` and will be removed in `1.0.0`.

### Usage

This component has the same interface as it's [ember-one-way-controls counterpart](https://github.com/DockYard/ember-one-way-controls/blob/master/docs/one-way-input.md), but accepts two additional arguments:

* `mask` The type of mask to put on the input
* `options` Any additional masking options from [Inputmask](https://github.com/RobinHerbots/Inputmask) you would like to add

## Other One Way Masks

* [{{one-way-credit-card-mask}}](docs/one-way-credit-card-mask.md)
* [{{one-way-currency-mask}}](docs/one-way-currency-mask.md)
* [{{one-way-date-mask}}](docs/one-way-date-mask.md)
* [{{one-way-number-mask}}](docs/one-way-number-mask.md)
* [{{one-way-phone-mask}}](docs/one-way-phone-mask.md)

## Input Mask Component (deprecated)

The standard `input-mask` component:

```hbs
{{input-mask mask='999-aaa-***' value=foo unmaskedValue=bar}}
```

### Default Masking Definitions

  - `9` : numeric
  - `a` : alphabetical
  - `*` : alphanumeric
  - `A` : automatically uppercased alphabetical
  - `#` : unicode

Optional portions of masks are delimited with brackets `[]`:

```hbs
// Optionally lets the user add the last dash and characters
{{input-mask mask='999-aaa[-***]' value=foo unmaskedValue=bar}}
```

### Unmasked Value

The mask is applied directly to the input itself, meaning it alters the `value`
attribute. There are times when you might want the value with the mask, and
times when you might want the value without the mask. For example:

```hbs
{{input-mask mask='99/99/9999' value=foo unmaskedValue=bar}}
```

This is an ad hoc mask for a date (consider using the `date-input` component
instead). If the user were to enter `12/12/2014`, the value of `foo` would be
just that, whereas the value of `bar` would be `12122014`, which may not be as
useful to you. Either way, both values are accessible and bound to each other,
so choose whichever one you want.

### Options

  - `maskPlaceholder` (default: `null`)

    Override Inputmask's default
    [`placeholder`](https://github.com/RobinHerbots/Inputmask#placeholder-1)
    option.

  - `showMaskOnFocus` (default: `true`)

    Shows the user a preview of the mask when the field is focussed.

  - `showMaskOnHover` (default: `true`)

    Shows the user a preview of the mask when the field is hovered.

  - `rightAlign` (default: `false`)

    This is an option on the original plugin, but I highly recommend using CSS
    classes because all it does is apply a style directly to the input.

  - `clearIncomplete` (default: `false`)

    If the user does not completely fill in the mask before defocus, it will
    clear the input.

  - `greedyMask` (default: `false`)

    If there are any optional portions of the mask this decides whether or not
    to display them in the preview.

## Other Components

As mentioned above, this addon include other components that extend the base
`input-mask` component. Some of simple aliases, but some add additional options.

### Credit Card Inputs (deprecated)

```hbs
{{credit-card-input unmaskedValue=foo cardType=bar separator=' '}}
```

The `credit-card-input` dynamically determines the type of the credit card and
changes the mask as appropriate. It currently has support for:

  - Visa
  - MasterCard
  - Amex
  - Diners Club
  - Discover
  - JCB

The card type is stored in `cardType`, which can be bound to. The separator for
numbers can be specified with the `separator` option, and defaults to `-`.

### Currency Inputs (deprecated)

```hbs
{{currency-input unmaskedValue=foo}}
```

This is just a wrapper for the Inputmask alias and is equivalent to the
following:

```hbs
{{input-mask mask='currency' unmaskedValue=foo}}
```

### Date Inputs (deprecated)

```hbs
{{date-input unmaskedValue=foo}}
```

This is just a wrapper for the Inputmask alias and is equivalent to the
following:

```hbs
{{input-mask mask='date' unmaskedValue=foo}}
```

### Email Inputs

```hbs
{{email-input unmaskedValue=foo}}
```

This is just a wrapper for the Inputmask alias and is equivalent to the
following:

```hbs
{{input-mask mask='email' unmaskedValue=foo}}
```

### Number Inputs (deprecated)

```hbs
{{number-input unmaskedValue=foo group=false groupSize=3 separator=',''
  decimal=false radix='.'}}
```

Number inputs only accept numbers, and can be modified using the following
options:

  - `group`: Display the number grouped for readability (e.g. `1,234` vs.
    `1234`).
  - `groupSize`: Change the size of the groups.
  - `separator`: Change the group separator. (Caveat: If radix and separator are
  the same, then the radix will default to '.'.)
  - `decimal`: If set to `true` then the input will be given 2 decimal places,
  if set some number then the input will be given that many decimal places.
  - `radix`: Sets the radix that separates the decimal places.
  - `digitsOptional`: Specify whether digits are optional (e.g. `97.00` vs. `97`)
  - `prefix`: Sets a prefix to be displayed before the number (e.g. `$97.00`)
  - `suffix`: Sets a suffix to be displayed after the number (e.g. `100%`)
  - `min`: Sets the minimum value for the field
  - `max`: Sets the maximum value for the field
  - `unmaskAsNumber`: Unmasks the input as a number rather than a string (e.g. `1234.56` vs. `'1234,56'`)

### US/Canada Phone Number Inputs (deprecated)

```hbs
{{phone-number-input unmaskedValue=foo extensions=false}}
```

Masks a US/Canada phone number with the format `(999) 999-9999`. The
`extensions` option can be set to `true` to allow up to 4 digit extensions
`(999) 999-9999 x 9999`. Note that if `greedyMask` is set to `false`, which is
the default, then you have to press space or 'x' to activate the extension part
of the mask when entering.

NOTE: There is a "phone" alias included in Inputmask, but when
I tried using it, I encountered slowness and freezeups. It is much more general
than this tag, however.

### US SSN Inputs

```hbs
{{ssn-input unmaskedValue=foo}}
```

Masks a US SSN code (`999-99-9999`).

### US ZIP Code Inputs

```hbs
{{zip-code-input unmaskedValue=foo fullCode=false}}
```

Masks a US ZIP code. If `fullCode` is set to `true`, then it will enable the
user to enter an extended ZIP+4 code.
