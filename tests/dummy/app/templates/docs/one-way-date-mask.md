## Output Format

You can change the `outputFormat` via the `options` hash from [Inputmask.js](https://github.com/RobinHerbots/Inputmask/blob/4.x/README_date.md)

Make sure the `value` you pass in matches the `inputFormat` that is expected. This may mean that
you pass in the **`masked`** value instead of the `unmasked` value
